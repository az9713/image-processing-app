# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an image processing project currently in its initial setup phase. The repository contains sample images in JPG format located in the `images/` directory.

## Current Structure

- `images/` - Contains sample JPG images (IMG_1229.JPG through IMG_1244.JPG) for processing and testing

## Development Setup

This project does not yet have a defined technology stack or build system. When implementing image processing functionality, consider:

- Choose appropriate image processing library (e.g., PIL/Pillow for Python, OpenCV, ImageMagick, etc.)
- Set up package management (requirements.txt for Python, package.json for Node.js, etc.)
- Implement processing scripts that work with the existing sample images in `images/`

## Sample Images

The repository includes 15 sample JPG images ranging from approximately 4-5MB each, suitable for testing various image processing operations such as:
- Format conversion
- Resizing and compression
- Filtering and enhancement
- Batch processing workflows
